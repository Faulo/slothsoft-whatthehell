		<h2>mediale* 2012</h2>
		<p>
			This was our entry for the
			<a href="http://www.mediale.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">mediale*</a>
			game jam in 2012.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was intended as a co-op game, but the 2 days we spent coding it weren't quite enough to make multiplayer work
			the way we wanted to, so it remained single-player.
		</p>
		<p>It was developed by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Daniel Schulz</li>
			<li>Claudia Osthof</li>
		</ul>
